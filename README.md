# Crypto Converter with React and Node.js

This project was built with:

- React
- Axios
- Sass
- Express
- RapidAPI

Choose your currency and hit convert to see the conversion and exchange rate. The latest in crypto news is also displayed on the dashboard. 

This project was a way for me to learn more about API's and how to use them. The styling is very basic because the focus was solely on the API implementation. 

I also learned how to create a mini backend to securely store my API key.
